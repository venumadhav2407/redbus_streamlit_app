## Project Title :  `Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium & Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit`
## Domain : Transportation


## Overview
> **This project demonstrates how to use `Selenium`, a web automation tool, to scrape bus ticket data from Redbus.com. It leverages `Streamlit`, a Python framework for building interactive web applications, to provide a dynamic user interface for filtering the scraped data.**

> **I combined scraped data from multiple Redbus state buses into a unified CSV file and standardized its format.**
> 
> **I use `SQLite3` as a database to store data of redbus.**
> 
> **Using `Streamlit` web framework for building dynamic filtering application for easy to use.**
