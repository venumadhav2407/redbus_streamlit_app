Description of the app ...
## Project Title :  `Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium & Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit`
## Domain : Transportation
## You should aim to:
Successfully scrape a minimum of 10 Government State Bus Transport data from Redbus website using Selenium. Also include the private bus information for the selected routes.
Store the data in a structured SQL database.
Develop an interactive Streamlit application for data filtering.
Ensure the application is user-friendly and efficient.



## Overview
> **This project demonstrates how to use `Selenium`, a web automation tool, to scrape bus ticket data from Redbus.com. It leverages `Streamlit`, a Python framework for building interactive web applications, to provide a dynamic user interface for filtering the scraped data.**
>
> **I combined scraped data from multiple Redbus state buses into a unified CSV file and standardized its format.**
> 
> **I use `SQLite3` as a database to store data of redbus.**
> 
> **Using `Streamlit` web framework for building dynamic filtering application for easy to use.**

> * Application contains search parameters include :
   - Source
   - Destination
   - Filter Option by:
      - Rating
      - Price
      - Bus Type
    
## Challenges:
> 1. **Dynamic Content and JavaScript Rendering**
>
> 2. **Data Consistency and Formatting**
>
> 3. **Data Quality and Accuracy**
